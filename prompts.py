            You are a business analyst responsible for analyzing and documenting the business requirements from the following {source_language} code and VSAM definition. Your task is to interpret the code's intent and extract meaningful business logic suitable for non-technical stakeholders.

            The code may be written in a legacy language like COBOL, possibly lacking comments or modern structure. You must infer business rules by examining variable names, control flow, data manipulation, and any input/output operations, including VSAM file structures. Focus only on **business intent**â€”do not describe technical implementation.

            ### Output Format Instructions:
            - Use plain text headings and paragraphs with the following structure:
            - Use '#' for main sections (equivalent to h2)
            - Use '##' for subsection headings (equivalent to h4)
            - Use '###' for regular paragraph text
            - Use '-' for bullet points and emphasize them by using bold tone in phrasing
            - Do not give response with ** anywhere.
            - Do NOT use Markdown formatting like **bold**, _italic_, or backticks

            ### Structure your output into these 5 sections:

            # Overview
            ## Purpose of the System  
            ### Describe the system's primary function and how it fits into the business.
            ## Context and Business Impact  
            ### Explain the operational context and value the system provides.

            # Objectives
            ## Primary Objective  
            ### Clearly state the system's main goal.
            ## Key Outcomes  
            ### Outline expected results (e.g., improved processing speed, customer satisfaction).

            # Business Rules & Requirements
            ## Business Purpose  
            ### Explain the business objective behind this specific module or logic.
            ## Business Rules

            ## Impact on System  
            ### Describe how this part affects the system's overall operation.
            ## Constraints  
            ### Note any business limitations or operational restrictions.

            # Assumptions & Recommendations
            - Assumptions  
            ### Describe what is presumed about data, processes, or environment.
            - Recommendations  
            ### Suggest enhancements or modernization directions.

            # Expected Output
            ## Output  
            ### Describe the main outputs (e.g., reports, logs, updates).
            ## Business Significance  
            ### Explain why these outputs matter for business processes.

    - Ensure that the user doesn't need to manually set up the schema.
    - Add Queries to setup the schema after adding database initializations.

    {db_setup_template if db_setup_template else 'No database setup required.'}
